I am in the process of overhauling this site. Before I had a hugo site (with a different theme) and a Wordpress instance located in a subdirectory. Now my life circumstances have changed, so the old collection of links doesn't make sense anymore. This software I'm using now allows me to posts, and given how little I have to say about myself, it doesn't make sense to have both this and the Wordpress blog.

I've already killed the link to my old blog accidentally just by fiddling with the settings, but I will make it official and remove it in the background as I continue to adjust this new theme.
